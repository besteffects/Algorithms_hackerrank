Sample Challenge
This is a simple challenge to get things started. Given a sorted array (arr) and a number (V), can you print the index
location of V in the array?

For example, if arr=[1,2,3] and V=3, you would print 2 for a zero-based index array.
If you are going to use the provided code for I/O, this next section is for you.

Function Description
Complete the introTutorial function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the zero-based index of V.
introTutorial has the following parameter(s):
arr: a sorted array of integers
V: an integer to search for
The next section describes the input format. You can often skip it, if you are using included methods or code stubs.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, V, a value to search for.
The next line contains an integer,n , the size of arr. The last line contains n space-separated integers, each a value of
arr[i] where 0<=i<n.

Output Format
Output the index of V in the array.
The next section describes the constraints and ranges of the input. You should check this section to know the range of the input.

Constraints
It is guaranteed that V will occur in arr exactly once.
This "sample" shows the first input test case. It is often useful to go through the sample to understand a challenge.
